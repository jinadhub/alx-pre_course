VIM or its precursor Vi comes preinstalled on macOS and almost all linux distributions. Knowing the basics of Vim is very helpful
in a situation where your favourite editor is not available. When you launch the Vim editor, you're in the normal mode. In this mode,
you can run Vim commands and navigate through the file.
